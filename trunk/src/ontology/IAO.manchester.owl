p is a assay 

assay:
process and has_input some material entity

a is a magnitude means a is a determinate quality particular inhering in some bearer b existing at a time t that can be represented/denoted by an information content entity e that has parts denoting a unit of measure, a number, and b. The unit of measure is an instance of the determinable quality. 

unit of measure is a quality, e.g. the length of a ruler.

a represents b means either a denotes b or a describes

describe:
a describes b means a is about b and a allows an inference of at least one quality of b

Example:

q = height of barry
p is the process using a tape measure extend across the longer part of barry and reading off the number at the far end.
v is that number
# dimension is height
unit of measure is inches

However we see several issues with this. First of all the name 'probe' might not be used in OBI. Instead we have a 'reporter' role. Also, albeit the term 'probe intensity' is often used in communities such as the microarray one, the name 'probe' is ambiguous (some use it to refer to what's on the array, some use it to refer to what's hybed to the array). Furthermore, this concept could possibly be encompassed by combining different OBI terms, such as the roles of analyte, detector and reporter (you need something hybed to a probe on the array to get an intensity) and maybe a more general term for 'measuring intensities'. We need to find the right balance between what is consistent with OBI and combinations of its terms and what is user-friendly. Finally, note that 'intensity' is already in the OBI .owl file and is also in PATO. Why didn't OBI import it from PATO? This might be a problem."@en,
