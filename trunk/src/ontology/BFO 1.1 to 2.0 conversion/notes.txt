1. Update term URIs of BFO and RO/OBI relations using doc/mapping.txt file

2. Import classes from external resources using OntoFox based on MIREOT strategy, generated import-OBO.owl

3. Change <owl:import> in IAO.owl and iao-main.owl, replace import external.owl and externalDerived.owl by import-OBO.owl

4. Clean up ontology headers including removing unused xmlns and owl:import of BFO 1.1 and RO and add import of BFO2.0 class only and RO core relations
        <owl:imports rdf:resource="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo/2014-05-03/classes-only.owl"/>
		<owl:imports rdf:resource="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ro/releases/2015-02-11/core.owl"/>


5. Remove any axioms related to imported terms in iao-main.owl

6. Add domain and range of ObjectiveProperties manually in externalByHand.owl since includes domain/range settings using OntoFox need to include all axioms recursively which will bring in unwanted classes and propteries


Current development version IAO has following OWL files:
	- IAO.owl		(import BFO2 classes only, RO core, and iao-main.owl, ontology-metadata.owl,import-OBO.owl,externalByHand.owl and obsolete.owl)
	- iao-main.owl	(same as IAO.owl but excludes obsolete.owl)
	- ontology-metadata.owl
	- import-OBO.owl
	- externalByHand.owl
	- obsolete.owl
