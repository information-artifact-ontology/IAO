The class-level relation transformation_of obtains between continuant classes C and C1 wherever each instance of the class C is such as to have existed at some earlier time as an instance of the distinct class C1 (see Figure 2 in paper). This relation is illustrated first of all at the molecular level of granularity by the relation between mature RNA and the pre-RNA from which it is processed\, or between (UV-induced) thymine-dimer and thymine dinucleotide. At coarser levels of granularity it is illustrated by the transformations involved in the creation of red blood cells\, for example\, from reticulocyte to erythrocyte\, and by processes of development\, for example\, from larva to pupa\, or from (post-gastrular) embryo to fetus or from child to adult. It is also manifest in pathological transformations\, for example\, of normal colon into carcinomatous colon.

def:"Parthood as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation p part_of p1 is illustrated in assertions such as: this instance of rhodopsin mediated phototransduction part_of this instance of visual perception.    This relation satisfies at least the following standard axioms of mereology: reflexivity (for all p\, p part_of p); anti-symmetry (for all p\, p1\, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p then p and p1 are identical); and transitivity (for all p\, p1\, p2\, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p2\, then p part_of p2). Analogous axioms hold also for parthood as a relation between spatial regions.    For parthood as a relation between continuants\, these axioms need to be modified to take account of the incorporation of a temporal argument. Thus for example the axiom of transitivity for continuants will assert that if c part_of c1 at t and c1 part_of c2 at t\, then also c part_of c2 at t.    Parthood as a relation between classes: To define part_of as a relation between classes we again need to distinguish the two cases of continuants and processes\, even though the explicit reference to instants of time now falls away. For continuants\, we have C part_of C1 if and only if any instance of C at any time is an instance-level part of some instance of C1 at that time\, as for example in: cell nucleus part_ of cell."

Note that this relation comprehends both the relation of exact location between one continuant and another which obtains when r and r1 are identical (for example\, when a portion of fluid exactly fills a cavity)\, as well as those sorts of inexact location relations which obtain\, for example\, between brain and head or between ovum and uterus" [OBO:imported "http://www.obofoundry.org/ro/ro.owl"]

To understand this relation\, we first define overlap for continuants as follows:    c1 overlap c2 at t =def for some c\, c part_of c1 at t and c part_of c2 at t.

The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is\, it tells us something about what happened earlier\, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction\, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is\, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations\, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by\, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants\, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation\, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example\, initiates or regulates) the other."
