The issues identified in http://code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology/issues/detail?id=79

There have been a number of issues that have arisen in working with
measurement data. First, there is the structural similarity between
some specifications, such as a dose, or a specification of length in
instructions on how long to cut a piece of wood, and measurement data,
in that both have values and units.

In addition Tom Russ and Gully Burns have raised the issue of
measurement scales a la Stevens
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement) which has the
potential to interfere with an orderly single inheritance hierarchy.

We can also discuss the example alluded to Melanie's issue report -
the handedness assay that we worked through.

Finally see a [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=06A279DD8870984A9AC6FB38AE00021F195B3E5355%40NIHMLBXBB02.nih.gov&forum_name=obi-devel discussion on obi-dev] regarding pH and empirical units.
