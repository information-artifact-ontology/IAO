We discussed the issue of representing postal addresses to IAO, settling on adding, at least, 'information about a location', and documenting a general pattern for representing information artifacts found in addresses, by using the denotes relation and terms from GEO and GAZ. Larry suggests we can autogenerate a number of useful terms from GEO/GAZ directly.

Some issues and cases:
 * A sample address that is "Ship number"
 * Whether addresses denote places or instructions for delivery
 * Addresses for a purpose (technical support, customer support, etc)
 * The initial case from Vaccine Ontology: Laboratory Address
 * Post office boxes - more of a way to get something to someone than a location
 * A common postal address type (there are a variety) as a collection of different types of entities, some denoting geopolitical regions of various granularities, such entities defined using GEO/GAZ.
 * Use for specifying what the contents of forms are 

== Action items == 

 * Add 'information about a location'
 * Write some examples of US postal addresses.
