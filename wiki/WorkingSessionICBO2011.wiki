 * Names, parts of names, and whether it's worth differentiating names on
the basis of the type of entity the name refers to (person, physical
location where mail is delivered, physical location where someone
lives, building, software application, instance of software
application) _Bill Hogan_

= Minutes = 

1. question of what is an IAO release
	- addition of curation statuses + announce of deprecation + sent around for review IAO-core

2. plan specification 

Every plan is a concretization of its plan specification
A plan can form the basis of an intentional action

Many protocols are plan specification that never become plan. 
example: any grant XX writes -> he never intends on doing what he says


DIE (directive information entity)
	is_about plan : not sufficient: many entities are about plan but are not DIE e.g., "this plan is in the corner of the room"

model: clinical study design written down somewhere (MB). Study design is subtype of plan specification which needs to be concretized but will never happen on piece of paper

=> proposal: has to be concretized as plan or sthg else.  Only plan specification (no other information artifact) can be concretized as a plan
import plan from OBI

3. OBO2OWL annotation properties

=> mapping problem with IAO, large community of OBO users

Barry: will define what is a synonym in an ontology
