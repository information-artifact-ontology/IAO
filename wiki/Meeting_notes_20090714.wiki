 * Larisa to send her use cases for "represents" - *DONE* - [http://code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology/wiki/RepresentsUseCase Represents use case]

 * Alan to review and propose sorting of IAO/OBI terms as he edits IAO in next 2 weeks.
 * All: submit issues under tracker, add comments to existing issues

*Discussion on generically_denotes and specifically_denotes*

Background material:
 * specifically denotes: http://code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology/wiki/specifically_denotes
 * generically denotes: http://code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology/wiki/generically_denotes
 * specific and generic dependence: http://code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology/wiki/Specific_and_generic_dependence
 * Issue 25 under IAO tracker: http://code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology/issues/detail?id=25

AI: Alan: make it clear that denotes has domain information content entity (related to http://code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology/issues/detail?id=28, domain of is_about)

specifically denote is primitive, generically denote built on that.
 # configuration 
see critical view at http://code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology/wiki/specifically_denotes

 # past tense (denoting in the absense of the entity)

 # specific versus generic

[some examples here - MC missed them - AR to update]

Information carriers are concretization of information content entities 
is_about relates information entities to thing

specifically_denotes domain is information carrier and not information entities -> issue (detailed at http://code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology/issues/detail?id=28)

Example:
The word Julius Cesar written on piece of paper is concretization of information entiity "Cesar"
-> what is the use for specifically denotes?
There is an instance of quality of my piece of paper which is concretization of information entity Julius Cesar which denotes Julius Cesar the man


Decision: keep only denotes, with domain information content entity

(
Other example offline, that MC found useful when discussing those relations:
- each boston sign specifically denotes
- the word boston generically denotes by virtue of the signs
=> boston generically denotes the city boston (an information entity) because there are several signs, each of those specifically denoting boston (a specific writing of the word)
)

AI: Alan: have a single denotes relationship (deprecate specifically- and generically denotes), from information content entity to thing.

Note: to understand denoting read Frege
link to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp) [MC- not sure why? AR to update]

Information content entities are associated with words in language but can be associated to more, eg diagrams, arm signs...
-> those are different concretizations of the same information content entity

== IAO tutorial prep ==

10 questions people will want to know about IAO

== Exploring Larisa's "represents" relation cases ==

 # You have the same data in more than one "format", e.g. XML, or Tab delimited.  
 # To relate two report graphs generated from the same data (visualization)
 # hypothesis. First english is presented, second logical is presented.

Current solution is to use is_about, but we may need a more specific relation. For example, relation between information content entity and material document is that the _material document_ *bears* a specifically dependent continuant that is the *concretization of* the  _information content entity_.
