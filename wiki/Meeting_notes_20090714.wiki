== Exploring Larisa's "represents" relation cases ==

 # You have the same data in more than one "format", e.g. XML, or Tab delimited.  
 # To relate two report graphs generated from the same data (visualization)
 # hypothesis. First english is presented, second logical is presented.

Current solution is to use is_about, but we may need a more specific relation. For example, relation between information content entity and material document is that the _material document_ *bears* a specifically dependent continuant that is the *concretization of* the  _information content entity_.
