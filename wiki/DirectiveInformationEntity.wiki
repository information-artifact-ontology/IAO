See issue at http://code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology/issues/detail?id=112


= Details =

In the following I will summarize the issues identified and the solutions proposed during the discussion. If you want to review the entire discussion please refer to the link above.

== Issues ==

=== Wording of the textual definition of "plan specification" ===

Currently the definition of plan specification reads:
"a directive information entity that when concretized it is realized in a process in which the bearer tries to achieve the objectives, in part by taking the actions specified. Plan specifications includes parts such as objective specification, action specifications and conditional specifications."
In the discussion we reached agreement on the fact that maybe this definition is not formulated in an easy and straightforward manner. The definition entails many aspects of the definition of a concretization of a plan specification which might raise misunderstandings.
Hitherto, no new formulation had been suggested or agreed upon. We should try to resolve this issue.

=== Differences between representation of "plan specification" in IAO and OBI ===



=== Alternative representation (maybe obsolete) ===
