== Minutes ==

IAO call: topic QTT and clinical test:

Attendees:
Bill Hogan, Melanie Courtot, Alan Ruttenberg, Philippe Rocca-Serra.


6 main topics:
--------------

1. modify analyte assay representation to accomodate reliance on unit as instance

relation should be modified from:
has_unit some <Unit Class>
to:
has_unit value <Unit Class>

2. lab test results may measure the same entity but will return results in possibly different units:
to represent the range of possible units, use:

has_unit value {<Unit Class1>,..,<Unit ClassN>}

3.mmol per liter [UO:300] is not available from OLS

*Action Item: Alan may have requested those and assumed they were added - he will check with UO

4. Assay measuring an enzymatic activity rate/volume as proxy for Protein presence and quantity:

First issue: -> analyte assay are defined as ('is quality measurement of' some 'molecular concentration') 
this somewhat does not apply to enzymatic activity concentration even though it is used as a proxy for a molecular concentration.

Second issue: -> is it not a true analyte assay?

NOTE: post-call: this answer is probably 'yes', 

-> Bill used UI/L which generically indicates a concentration.

these types of assay do not measure directly the amount of proteins rather, they measure the rate of conversion of substrate  by protein assuming a proportional relation between this rate and the amount for functional protein present in the 'evaluant'

The unit needed is missing and would back measuring the amount of catalytic activity to a reference volume

*Action Item: submit to UO

Discussion about setting quality automatically upon selection of unit
AR: not always possible

Option: have more general relation towards other types of entities

5. Discussion about "normal ranges"

Issue: Should clinical assay representation include information about upper and lower measurement values considered as "normal"?

Defining 'normality values' is hard as those vary depending  on species, physiological / pathological state
(for reference, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blood_values_sorted_by_mass_and_molar_concentration.png)
-> overly complex.

Key observation by Bill Hogan: " normal range is passed around with result of a test" so might be worth considering the following representation

Main modification is to changing the specific output of an assay 
model scalar measurement datum with range -> + extra template to generate subtype of normal value
the issue is that a lab test typically carries in its result both the tested value and the upper and
lower range of normal for that test instance

For evaluation purpose though, a QTT could be modified to test the feasibility of the following representation:
"human normal blood sodium concentration value" is_a "normal value"
has_measurement_value some  [< 38 >32]
has_measurement_unit mg/dL

Simplest case two extra columns to the template to allow reporting of (min , max) normal.


6. Derived Measurements computed from Measurement values resulting from analyte assays:

Some tests as described in OBI-QTT-Analyte-Assay.xls document such "BUN/Cr ratio" or "albumin/globulin ratio" aren't really 'analyte assay', rather should be data transformation where the specific_inputs are measurement values from BUN and Creatinine analyte assays.
 
For simple ratios, a new qtt could be create where numerator and denominator are specified -> more discussion needed.
