==Information Artifact Ontology (IAO)==
The Information Artifact Ontology (IAO) is an ontology of information entities, originally driven by work by the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) digital entity and realizable information entity branch. For more information, see the project home page at http://code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology/  

==Ontology metadata==
The ontology metadata file contains all the terms required to annotate an ontology or ontology term developed in OWL format. Currently it is part of the IAO project and has been widely used in the OBO Foundry community when developing an ontology in OWL format. For more information, see the ontology metadata wiki page at: [https://code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology/wiki/OntologyMetadata]
