 #summary Working session at ICBO 2012

= Introduction =

A working session on IAO is organized on Saturday July 21st, 6-8pm during the ICBO conference. 

This event is targeted at members of the IAO developers group. While everybody will be welcome to attend, there won’t be any general presentation of the IAO, and attendees are expected to be very familiar with the IAO. Agenda will be limited to those items that have been approved for discussion by the community of developers. If you are planning to attend, please help us plan by adding your name to the attendee list below. Add any topic you want to see discussed to the agenda, specifying your name as proposer (e.g. "topic X, proposed by Y)

= Agenda =

  * *ICE and parts:* In a CTSA meeting regarding ontologies the question was brought up whether an instance of a plan specification that has_part an instance of an objectives specification, once the objective specification changes this PS stays the same. Analogy to ICs suggest it does, but participants expressed interest in further discussion (proposed by Mathias).

  * *IAO Top Nodes Working Group:* I want to propose and discuss starting a small group of IAO developers who are interested and have time at their hands to work on optimizing the upper level of IAO (not BFO, of course, but the classes immediately below 'information content entity') and come up with a consistent hierarchy and consistent definitions. In the past we had worked on single examples of inconsistency (e.g. data item and measurement datum), but I feel it would be beneficial to look at the big picture and get things in line. My proposal is that the working group works on providing a proposal at ICBO 2013 to the IAO community. Meanwhile there will be progress reports on the mailing list to enable discussion. (Proposed by Mathias)

  * *IAO Releases:* Can the working group assemble volunteers for making this more regular and getting a newer version into Bioportal (current verison is THREE years old)? Do we want to upload release version of IAO made for each OBI release to Bioportal or only major release? Do we need to vote for switching to BFO 2.0?
(Notes by Jie: IAO has a release version with each OBI release until the end of last year which are not uploaded to Bioportal.)
 

  * *iao:data item:* Lately, members of the OBI developer list have intensively discussed iao:data_item and issues related to the definition and representation of data items as outputs of measurements, predictions and as part of plan specifications (like device settings). To provide a consistent representation of data items used in and obtained from biomedical investigations in OBI these issues need to be resolved (proposed by Christian). Starting by the problematic notion of data items as "true" ICEs ([http://groups.google.com/group/information-ontology/browse_frm/thread/3a4bbd7a962d8ba1/efced0aab4397f0c?#efced0aab4397f0c 1]) several problems were exposed on the OBI list, specifically it was discussed that:
    * the textual definition of iao:data item may need to be revised: data items aren't statements, they are part of statements and as such they are neither true nor false (whereas the statements which they can be part of are) ([http://groups.google.com/group/information-ontology/msg/efced0aab4397f0c 2])
    * data items can be the result of measurements or predictions or part of plan specifications. In the case of predictions it is not so clear what they are about and also the "aboutness" appears to be different from how a measurement datum is about a (real) thing being measured. In plan specification they play yet a different role. To resolve this creating a class 'value specification' or 'value denotation' has been suggested ([http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29342482 3],[http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29423064 4]) or, alternatively, to create different subclasses of iao:is_about to convey different types of aboutness ([http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29421507 5],[http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29453949 6])
(Notes by Jie: Data item can be used as software setting specification, input parameter, which is part of a plan specification. However, not all setting specification are data item. Would like to cover software setting specification in the discussion if possible.) 
    * suggestions have been made for corresponding textual/logical definitions or superclass expressions ([http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29421507 5],[http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29453949 6])
    * there is an inconsistency between the 'measurement unit label' definition and its subclass as a consequence of mireoting UO classes ([http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29459064 7])
