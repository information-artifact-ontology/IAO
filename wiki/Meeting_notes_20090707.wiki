= IAO Meeting notes of July 7th 2009 =

== Details ==

 * Convened by: Melanie, Alan 
 * Notes by: Melanie
 * Where: Skype
 * Attendees:  Larisa, Chris, Bjoern, James, Alan, Melanie

== Some topics discussed ==

 * Changing name of "information content entity" to "information artifact" / Clarifying scope of IAO - connected with [http://code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology/issues/detail?id=21 Issue 21] 
 * Sorting what goes in IAO versus OBI
 * Relation between data and visualization (leads to Larisa's use of "represents" relationship)

== Exploring Larisa's "represents" relation cases ==

 # You have the same data in more than one "format", e.g. XML, or Tab delimited.  
 # To relate two report graphs generated from the same data (visualization)
 # hypothesis. First english is presented, second logical is presented.

Current solution is to use is_about, but we may need a more specific relation. For example, relation between information content entity and material document is that the _material document_ *bears* a specifically dependent continuant that is the *concretization of* the  _information content entity_.


== Action items == 
 * James will check how to link data and their visualization - example: clustered data visualization (process) has_specified_input only clustered data and has_specified_output some dot plot or..... (list)
 * Chris to identify if there is anything in IAO holding up DENRIE, and submit issues if any under tracker.
 * Melanie to make describes and represents obsolete (at least until they have definitions)
 * Larisa to send her use cases for "represents"
 * Alan to work on the definition of denotes and specifically denotes (cf http://code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology/issues/detail?id=25)
 * Bjoern to review relations and submit issues if any under the tracker
 * Alan to review and propose sorting of IAO/OBI terms as he edits IAO in next 2 weeks.
 * All: submit issues under tracker, add comments to existing issues
