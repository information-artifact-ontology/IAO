1. Import classes from external resources using OntoFox based on MIREOT strategy, generated import-OBO.owl

2. Change <owl:import> in IAO.owl and iao-main.owl, replace import external.owl and externalDerived.owl by import-OBO.owl

3. Delete imported relations which will be replaced by BFO 2.0 relations

4. Modify xml:base and xmlns of externalByHand.owl and obsolete.owl for making these files loaded from local documents using OWL-API

5. Update IRIs based on mapping file

6. Clean up ontology headers including removing unused xmlns and owl:import of BFO 1.1 and RO and add import of BFO2.0 class only

7. Add BFO 2.0 relations in externalByHand.owl


Got inconsistency when running Hermit 1.3.8 because 'information conponent' has part was used in defining subClasses of 'cartesian spatial coordinate datum', such as:
	denotes some 
	    ('zero-dimensional spatial region'
     and ('componet of information entity' some 'one-dimensional spatial region'))
     
'componet of information entity' with domain and range ICE, so, what should we use here?
